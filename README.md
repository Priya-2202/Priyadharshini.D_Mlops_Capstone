# MLOps Capstone Project: Retail Store & Customer Insights

This project is an end-to-end analytics and machine learning pipeline designed to provide actionable insights into a retail chain's store performance and customer behavior. It processes daily sales data, segments customers using an ML model, and serves the findings through a REST API and an interactive web dashboard.

## 🎯 Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to build a robust MLOps pipeline that transforms raw retail data into strategic business insights. The system automates data processing, performs RFM-based customer segmentation, and analyzes key business metrics like store performance, profitability, and seasonal trends. These insights are then made accessible to stakeholders via a FastAPI backend and a Streamlit-powered dashboard.

## ✨ Key Features

* **Automated Data Pipeline:** Cleans, transforms, and enriches raw sales data automatically.
* **ML-Powered Customer Segmentation:** Uses **RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)** analysis combined with a **K-Means clustering** model to identify distinct customer segments like "Champions," "Loyal," and "At Risk."
* **Performance Analytics:** Compares sales volume, revenue, and transaction counts across different stores.
* **Profitability Insights:** Calculates the impact of discounts on net sales for each product category.
* **Trend Analysis:** Identifies monthly and quarterly sales patterns to understand seasonality.
* **Interactive Dashboard:** A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for visualizing all key metrics and insights.
* **REST API:** A scalable backend built with FastAPI to serve the processed data and analytics results.
* **Campaign Simulation:** An interactive tool to model the potential ROI of marketing campaigns targeted at specific customer segments.

### Process to Run it on Local VM:
## ⚙️ Setup and Installation

Follow these steps to set up the project environment on your local machine.

### Prerequisites
* Python 3.8 or higher
* pip package manager

### Installation Steps
1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repository-url>
    cd MLOps_Capstone_Project
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    * **Windows:**
        ```bash
        python -m venv venv
        .\venv\Scripts\activate
        ```
    * **macOS / Linux:**
        ```bash
        python3 -m venv venv
        source venv/bin/activate
        ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## 🚀 How to Run the Project

The project consists of three main components that need to be run in order.

### Step 1: Process the Data
First, run the data processing script to generate the `processed_customer_data.parquet` file from the raw CSV.

```bash
python src/data_processing.py
```

### Step 2: Start the FastAPI Server
Next, start the API server, which will serve the data to the dashboard.

```bash
uvicorn src.api:app --reload
```
The API will be available at `http://127.0.0.1:8000`. You can access the auto-generated documentation at `http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs`.

### Step 3: Launch the Streamlit Dashboard
Finally, in a **new terminal**, run the Streamlit dashboard.

```bash
streamlit run src/dashboard.py
```
The interactive dashboard will open in your web browser, usually at `http://localhost:8501`.
