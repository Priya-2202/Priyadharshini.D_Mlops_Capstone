üéØ Project Overview
The primary goal of this project is to build a robust and automated MLOps pipeline that transforms raw retail data into strategic business intelligence. The system ingests daily sales data, performs RFM-based customer segmentation using a K-Means clustering model, and analyzes key business metrics. These insights are then exposed through a scalable FastAPI backend and visualized in a user-friendly Streamlit dashboard, enabling data-driven decision-making for marketing and sales strategies.

‚ú® Key Features
Automated Data Pipeline: Ingests, cleans, and transforms raw sales data into an analysis-ready format.

ML-Powered Customer Segmentation: Implements RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis combined with K-Means clustering to categorize customers into meaningful segments (e.g., "Champions," "Loyal," "At Risk").

Store Performance Analytics: Delivers comparative insights on sales volume, revenue, and transaction counts across all retail locations.

Profitability & Discount Analysis: Calculates the net impact of discounts on sales revenue for each product category.

Seasonal Trend Identification: Analyzes monthly and quarterly sales patterns to uncover and visualize business seasonality.

Interactive Dashboard: A user-friendly web application built with Streamlit for visualizing key metrics, customer segments, and performance trends.

RESTful API: A scalable API built with FastAPI to programmatically serve processed data and analytics results.

Campaign ROI Simulator: An interactive tool to model the potential return on investment for marketing campaigns targeted at specific customer segments.

üèóÔ∏è System Architecture
The project follows a sequential data flow:

Data Ingestion: The data_processing.py script reads the raw customer_shopping_data.csv.

Data Processing & Modeling: The script cleans the data, performs RFM analysis, and applies a K-Means clustering model to segment customers. The enriched data is saved as processed_customer_data.parquet.

API Layer: The FastAPI application (api.py) loads the processed parquet file and exposes various endpoints to serve the data and insights.

Presentation Layer: The Streamlit dashboard (dashboard.py) consumes data from the FastAPI endpoints to create interactive visualizations and reports for the end-user.

üöÄ Getting Started
Follow these instructions to set up and run the project on your local machine.

Prerequisites
Python (version 3.8 or higher)

pip package manager

Installation
Clone the Repository

git clone <your-repository-url>
cd MLOps_Capstone_Project

Create and Activate a Virtual Environment

Windows:

python -m venv venv
.\venv\Scripts\activate

macOS / Linux:

python3 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate

Install Dependencies

pip install -r requirements.txt

Running the Application
The project components must be run in the following order.

Step 1: Process the Data
Run the data processing script to generate the processed_customer_data.parquet file. This only needs to be done once.

python src/data_processing.py

Step 2: Start the FastAPI Server
Start the API server using Uvicorn. The --reload flag enables hot-reloading for development.

uvicorn src.api:app --reload

The API will be available at http://127.0.0.1:8000. Interactive documentation (Swagger UI) can be accessed at http://127.0.0.1:8000/docs.

Step 3: Launch the Streamlit Dashboard
In a new terminal, run the Streamlit application.

streamlit run src/dashboard.py

The dashboard will automatically open in your web browser, typically at http://localhost:8501.

üåê API Endpoints
The FastAPI server provides the following endpoints to access the analytics data.

Method

Endpoint
